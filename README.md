The program is designed to simulate the development indicators of a gas field using a system of material balance equations.
The subject of modeling is a gas reservoir or gas reservoirs united by one hydrodynamic system and developed by a single system of wells.
The theoretical foundations of the material balance method, a closed system of equations, the justification of algorithms, the correlations used can be found in our articles. 
The three main stages of modeling are: 
•         The first is the formation of a data file about the object in Excel 
•         The second is the actual modeling 
•         And the third analysis of the results recorded in the output file also on Excel
